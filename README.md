## About the project

This Laravel application generates the Fibonacci sequence based on a user input number. It features a form where users can input a number, and upon submission, the application calculates and displays the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. The application includes input validation to ensure users enter a non-negative integer and utilizes an efficient iterative method for Fibonacci sequence calculation. Results are presented as a comma-separated list.


## Usage
- Enter a non-negative integer in the input field.
- Click the "Generate" button.
- The Fibonacci sequence up to the entered number will be displayed on the same page.
